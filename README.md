# Project: Admin Dashboard
This is the sixth project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.   

The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).   

The demo page is [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/admin-dashboard/).         
   
The admin-dashboard page has been created based on [the design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).    
   
In this project, I was able to practice especially grid and flexbox techniques. In addition, a responsive design is implemented without using the media query.   
   
Last but not least, while working on the project, I have also tried to use the best practice for writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
